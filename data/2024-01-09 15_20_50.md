For testing the Network MSeries Router MX480, we can create the following unit test cases:

### Test Case 1: Power On Self Test (POST) 
**Description:** Ensure that the router successfully completes the POST process upon power on.

**Test Steps:**
1. Power on the router.
2. Check the console or log output for any POST errors.
   
**Expected Output:** 
The router should complete the POST process without any errors.

### Test Case 2: Interface Configuration
**Description:** Verify the configuration of network interfaces on the router.

**Test Steps:**
1. Configure a sample network interface with specific parameters (e.g., IP address, subnet mask).
2. Verify that the interface is successfully configured.

**Expected Output:** 
The configured interface should be up and running without any errors.

### Test Case 3: Routing Protocol
**Description:** Validate the routing protocol functionality on the router.

**Test Steps:**
1. Set up a basic routing protocol, such as OSPF or BGP.
2. Verify that the routing protocol is established and functioning correctly.

**Expected Output:** 
The router should establish the routing protocol and be able to exchange routing information with neighboring routers.

### Test Case 4: High Availability
**Description:** Test the failover and redundancy features of the router.

**Test Steps:**
1. Simulate a failure scenario (e.g., primary router goes down).
2. Verify that the secondary router takes over and maintains network connectivity.

**Expected Output:** 
The secondary router should seamlessly take over and maintain network operations without any noticeable interruption.

### Test Case 5: Traffic Management
**Description:** Evaluate the router's ability to manage network traffic.

**Test Steps:**
1. Generate varying levels of network traffic.
2. Monitor the router's performance in handling the traffic load.

**Expected Output:** 
The router should effectively manage the network traffic without causing congestion or significant packet loss.

```python
def test_POST():
    router = MX480()
    power_on(router)
    assert router.check_POST() == "No errors found"

def test_interface_configuration():
    router = MX480()
    interface = NetworkInterface("eth0", "192.168.1.1", "255.255.255.0")
    router.configure_interface(interface)
    assert router.verify_interface(interface) == "Interface configured successfully"

def test_routing_protocol():
    router = MX480()
    protocol = OSPF()
    router.configure_routing_protocol(protocol)
    assert router.verify_routing_protocol(protocol) == "Routing protocol established"

def test_high_availability():
    router1 = MX480()
    router2 = MX480()
    simulate_failover(router1)
    assert router2.check_active() == True

def test_traffic_management():
    router = MX480()
    traffic = generate_traffic()
    router.manage_traffic(traffic)
    assert router.check_traffic_performance() == "Stable performance"
```

```python
def test_routing():
    # Verify proper routing functionality
    assert verify_routing() == True
    
def test_interface_connectivity():
    # Check interface connectivity
    assert check_interface_connectivity() == True
    
def test_network_performance():
    # Measure network performance
    performance_result = measure_network_performance()
    assert performance_result > 0.9
```
