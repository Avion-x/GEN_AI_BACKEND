# Regression Test for MX480

## Test Case 1: Interface Connectivity

### Setup
- Ensure that the MX480 is powered on and connected to the network.
- Verify that all interfaces are properly configured and connected.

### Execution
1. Ping a known external IP address from each interface.
2. Verify that the ping is successful.

### Verification
- Check the output of the ping command to ensure that there are no packet drops or high latency.

### Teardown
- Disconnect the interfaces and reset their configurations.

## Test Case 2: Routing Functionality

### Setup
- Ensure that the MX480 has a basic routing configuration set up.
- Verify that the routing table is populated with the correct routes.

### Execution
1. Send a test packet from a source to a destination within the network.
2. Check that the packet follows the correct route as per the routing table.

### Verification
- Use the "show route" command to verify that the test packet followed the expected route.

### Teardown
- Remove the test routing configuration and reset the routing table.

```bash
show route
```

## Test Case 3: High Availability

### Setup
- Configure a high availability setup with redundant hardware and protocols.
- Ensure that failover mechanisms are enabled and functioning.

### Execution
1. Simulate a failure in one of the hardware components.
2. Verify that the failover mechanism kicks in and the system continues to operate without interruption.

### Verification
- Check system logs and status indicators to confirm that the failover occurred as expected.

### Teardown
- Restore the failed hardware component and reset the high availability configuration.

### MX480 Python Regression Test

#### Introduction
The MX480 Python regression test is used to verify the functionality and performance of the MX480 using Python scripts. This test is crucial for ensuring that new changes or updates to the MX480 do not impact its core functionality and performance.

#### Test Data
Below are the details of the Python regression test for the MX480:

**Test Type:** Regression Test
**Device:** MX480
**Tested Functionality:** Core functionality and performance

#### Test Steps
1. Establish a connection to the MX480 device using Python.
   
   ```python
   import paramiko

   ssh = paramiko.SSHClient()
   ssh.set_missing_host_key_policy(paramiko.AutoAddPolicy())
   ssh.connect('mx480_ip_address', username='username', password='password')
   ```

2. Send commands to the MX480 device to execute regression test cases.

   ```python
   stdin, stdout, stderr = ssh.exec_command('show version')
   print(stdout.read())
   ```

3. Evaluate and analyze the output of the executed commands for regression test results.

   ```python
   # Perform analysis on the command output
   ```

4. Close the SSH connection to the MX480 device.

   ```python
   ssh.close()
   ```

5. Record and document the test results.

#### Test Results
The test results will vary depending on the specific regression test cases executed. However, the Python regression test will provide insights into the functioning and performance of the MX480 device based on the commands executed and their output.

#### Conclusion
The Python regression test for the MX480 is an integral part of ensuring the reliability and stability of the device. By consistently running these regression tests, any issues or regressions can be identified and addressed promptly, maintaining the integrity of the MX480.

# Regression Test for MX480 Router Configuration
The following regression test aims to thoroughly verify the configuration of the MX480 router by running detailed tests.

## Test Environment
- MX480 router with the latest software update
- Test network environment

## Test Scenarios
1. Verify the routing tables are properly configured
2. Ensure all interfaces are up and running
3. Test for any misconfigured firewall rules
4. Validate the MPLS configuration
5. Check for any errors in BGP configuration
6. Verify the correct functioning of QoS policies

## Test Procedure
1. Access the CLI of the MX480 router using SSH or terminal.
2. Run the following commands to gather the necessary data:
   
   ```shell
   show route
   show interfaces terse
   show configuration firewall
   show configuration protocols mpls
   show configuration protocols bgp
   show configuration class-of-service
   ```

## Test Data
### Routing Tables
- The routing tables show the correct routes for different network destinations.
- Route table data:

```
Destination        Nexthop
10.0.0.0/24        192.168.1.1
192.168.0.0/24     10.10.1.1
```

### Interface Status
- All interfaces should be up and in the correct state.
- Interface status:
  
```
Interface    Status
ge-0/0/0     up
ge-0/0/1     up
```

### Firewall Configuration
- Firewall configuration should not have any misconfigured rules.
- Firewall configuration:

```shell
firewall {
    family inet {
        filter 1 {
            term 1 {
                from {
                    source-address 192.168.1.0/24;
                }
                then accept;
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### MPLS Configuration
- MPLS should be configured and operational without errors.
- MPLS configuration:

```shell
protocols {
    mpls {
        label-switched-path LSP1 {
            to 10.0.0.1;
        }
    }
}
```

### BGP Configuration
- BGP configuration should not contain any errors.
- BGP configuration:

```shell
protocols {
    bgp {
        group internal {
            type internal;
            local-address 192.168.0.1;
            family inet {
                unicast;
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### QoS Policies
- QoS policies should be correctly configured and functioning.
- QoS configuration:

```shell
class-of-service {
    interfaces {
        ge-0/0/0 {
            shaping-rate 1m;
        }
    }
}
```

By thoroughly examining the data gathered from the above tests, we can confirm the proper configuration of the MX480 router.
