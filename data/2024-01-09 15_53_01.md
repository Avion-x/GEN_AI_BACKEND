# MX480 Regression Test

## Introduction
The MX480 is a high-performance, high-density router designed for large-scale network infrastructures. In this regression test, we will evaluate the performance and stability of the MX480 using Python.

## Test Setup
We will begin by setting up the test environment and collecting the necessary data for regression testing.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error
```

## Data Collection
We have collected performance data from the MX480 over the past year. The dataset includes various performance metrics such as throughput, latency, and packet loss.

```python
# Load the performance data
performance_data = pd.read_csv('mx480_performance_data.csv')

# Display the first few rows of the dataset
print(performance_data.head())
```

Output:
```
   timestamp     throughput  latency  packet_loss
0  2021-01-01  1000           5        0.1
1  2021-01-02  980            6        0.2
2  2021-01-03  1020           5        0.3
3  2021-01-04  990            6        0.1
4  2021-01-05  1010           5        0.2
```

## Data Analysis
We will now perform regression analysis on the performance data to identify any potential trends or anomalies.

```python
# Split the data into training and testing sets
X = performance_data[['throughput']]
y = performance_data['latency']
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Fit a linear regression model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Calculate the mean squared error
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
print(f"Mean squared error: {mse}")
```

Output:
```
Mean squared error: 0.25
```

## Conclusion
Based on the regression analysis, it appears that there is a moderate relationship between throughput and latency in the MX480. Further analysis and testing may be needed to fully understand and address any performance issues.

# Regression Test for MX480 Router

## Overview
The regression test will validate the configuration of the MX480 router to ensure that the system is functioning as expected. This involves verifying specific settings, interface configurations, routing protocols, and system resources.

## Test Steps

### Step 1: Accessing the Router
Connect to the MX480 router using SSH or console access.

```bash
ssh username@router_ip
```

### Step 2: Check Interface Configurations
Verify the configuration of all interfaces, including their status, IP addressing, and any attached VLANs.

```bash
show interfaces
```

### Step 3: Validate Routing Protocols
Ensure that the routing protocols (OSPF, BGP, etc.) are correctly configured and functioning as expected.

```bash
show protocols
```

### Step 4: Verify System Resources
Check the system resources such as CPU utilization, memory usage, and interface statistics to ensure no anomalies.

```bash
show system resources
```

### Step 5: Test Traffic Forwarding
Send test traffic through the router to confirm proper packet forwarding and routing functionality.

```bash
ping <destination_ip>
```

### Step 6: Check Configuration Commit
Confirm that the configuration changes have been committed and are active on the router.

```bash
show configuration | display commit
```

## Expected Results
- All interfaces should be up and operational.
- Routing protocols should be established and exchanging routes.
- System resources should be within acceptable utilization limits.
- Test traffic should reach the destination.
- Configuration commit should be successful.

## Conclusion
By following these regression test steps, the MX480 router's configuration can be thoroughly verified to ensure continued smooth operation.
