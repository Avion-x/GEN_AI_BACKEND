System Capacity—MX480 provides 9 Tbps of system capacity for a wide range of cloud,
campus, enterprise, data center, service provider, cable, and mobile service core applications.
Always-on Infrastructure Base—MX Series routers ensure network and service availability with
a broad set of multilayered physical, logical, and protocol-level resiliency aspects. Junos
Operating System Virtual Chassis technology on MX Series routers supports chassis-level
redundancy and enables you to manage two routers as a single element. Multichasis link
aggregation group (MC-LAG) implementation supports stateful chassis, card, and port
redundancy. Application-Aware Networking—On MX Series routers, you can use deep packet
inspection to detect applications, and by using the user-defined policies, you can determine
traffic treatment for each application. This feature enables highly customized and differentiated
services at scale.
