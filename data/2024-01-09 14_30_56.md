### Unit Test Cases for Network MSeries Router MX480

#### Test Case 1: Power On Self Test (POST)

##### Description:
This test case ensures that the router successfully completes the Power On Self Test (POST) without any errors.

##### Test Steps:
1. Power on the router.
2. Observe the console output for any POST error messages.

##### Expected Result:
The router should complete the POST without any errors.

```
Console Output:
POST Passed - No errors
```

#### Test Case 2: Interface Connectivity

##### Description:
This test case verifies the connectivity of the router interfaces.

##### Test Steps:
1. Connect a testing device to each interface (Ethernet, OCX, SONET, etc.).
2. Verify the link status and interface configuration using show commands.

##### Expected Result:
All interfaces should show a link status of "UP" and the interface configurations should match the expected settings.

```
show interfaces status
Interface       Link Status     Configuration
----------------------------------------------
ge-0/0/0        UP              Full Duplex
ge-0/0/1        UP              Half Duplex
...
```

#### Test Case 3: Routing Functionality

##### Description:
This test case verifies the routing functionality of the router.

##### Test Steps:
1. Configure static and dynamic routing protocols (e.g. OSPF, BGP).
2. Verify the routing table and routing protocol adjacencies.

##### Expected Result:
The routing table should populate with expected routes and routing protocol adjacencies should be established.

```
show route
Routing table:
---------------------------------------------
Destination     Next Hop       Interface
---------------------------------------------
0.0.0.0/0        192.168.1.1    ge-0/0/0
...

show ospf neighbor
Neighbor ID     State          Interface
---------------------------------------
192.168.2.1     Full           ge-0/0/1
...
```

#### Test Case 4: High Availability

##### Description:
This test case ensures high availability features of the router, such as graceful restart and non-stop routing.

##### Test Steps:
1. Trigger a router failover or switchover event.
2. Verify that routing continues to function seamlessly during the failover.

##### Expected Result:
Routing should remain uninterrupted during the failover event.

```
show system switchover
Switchover Status: Complete
```

#### Test Case 5: Performance and Scalability

##### Description:
This test case assesses the performance and scalability of the router under high load conditions.

##### Test Steps:
1. Generate a high volume of traffic through the router.
2. Monitor CPU, memory, and interface utilization during the traffic load.

##### Expected Result:
The router should maintain stable performance and minimal packet loss under high load.

```
show system statistics
CPU Utilization: 40%
Memory Usage: 60%
Interface Utilization: < 80%
```

These unit test cases cover the basic functionality, connectivity, routing, high availability, and performance aspects of the Network MSeries Router MX480.
