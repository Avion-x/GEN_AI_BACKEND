3. Security Test - Ensure that the MX480 is equipped with features that protect you from potential threats.
4. Usability Test - Test the user experience of configuring the MX480 router.

Test Scripts
1. Functionality Test
Setup: Download and install driver for the MX480 router.
Execution: Preform a basic functionality test with a variety of traffic loads, message sizes, packet flows, etc.
Verification: Review the results to ensure the router meets functionality requirements.
Teardown: Uninstall the driver.

2. Performance Test
Setup: Connect the MX480 router to a testing environment.
Execution: Run performance tests such as throughput, latency, and jitter with a heavy workload.
Verification: Review the results to determine whether the router is meeting performance requirements.
Teardown: Disconnect the router from the testing environment.

3. Security Test
Setup: Configure the MX480 router with robust security protocols.
Execution: Preform security tests such as firewalls, authentication, intrusion prevention, secure remote access, etc.
Verification: Review the results to ensure the router meets security requirements.
Teardown: Disable the security protocols.

Python sample code for the Security Test of MX480 router

import os
from datetime import datetime

# Setup
os.system("configure terminal")
# Configure security protocols
os.system("firewall enable")
os.system("auth enable")
os.system("intrusion prevention enable")
os.system("remote access enable")

# Execution
os.system("start security test")

# Verfication
log = os.system("show log")
print("Security test results: ")
print(log)

# Teardown
os.system("disable firewall")
os.system("disable auth")
os.system("disable intrusion prevention")
os.system("disable remote access")

### Unit Test Cases for Network MSeries Router MX480

#### Test Case 1: Power On Self-Test (POST)
1. **Test Objective:** Verify that the router successfully passes the Power On Self-Test (POST) upon boot up.
2. **Test Steps:**
   - Power on the router.
   - Observe the router's console output for any POST errors.
   - Verify that the router boots up without any POST errors.
3. **Expected Output:** The router should boot up successfully without any POST errors.

#### Test Case 2: Interface Connectivity Test
1. **Test Objective:** Validate the connectivity of various interfaces (e.g., Ethernet, Optical) on the router.
2. **Test Steps:**
   - Connect devices to various interfaces on the router.
   - Send data packets through each interface.
   - Verify that data packets are successfully transmitted and received without loss.
3. **Expected Output:** Data packets should be successfully transmitted and received through all interfaces without loss.

#### Test Case 3: Routing Protocol Functionality
1. **Test Objective:** Ensure the proper functioning of routing protocols (e.g., OSPF, BGP) on the router.
2. **Test Steps:**
   - Configure and enable routing protocols on the router.
   - Verify that routing tables are populated correctly.
   - Send test traffic and ensure that it follows the expected routing paths.
3. **Expected Output:** Routing tables should be populated correctly, and test traffic should follow the expected routing paths.

#### Test Case 4: High Availability and Redundancy
1. **Test Objective:** Test the high availability features and redundancy options of the router.
2. **Test Steps:**
   - Simulate a failure scenario (e.g., link failure, interface failure).
   - Observe the router's behavior in response to the failure.
   - Verify that the router fails over to redundant components and continues operation without disruption.
3. **Expected Output:** The router should fail over to redundant components and continue operation without disruption in the event of a failure scenario.

#### Test Case 5: Quality of Service (QoS) Configuration
1. **Test Objective:** Validate the configuration and functionality of Quality of Service (QoS) settings on the router.
2. **Test Steps:**
   - Configure QoS policies and prioritize different types of traffic.
   - Send test traffic and ensure that it is handled according to the QoS policies.
3. **Expected Output:** Test traffic should be handled according to the configured QoS policies.

```python
# Sample Code Snippet for QoS Configuration Test
qos_policy = {
  "policy_name": "VoIP_Priority",
  "traffic_type": "VoIP",
  "priority_level": "High"
}

apply_qos_policy(interface="ethernet1/1", qos_policy)
```
